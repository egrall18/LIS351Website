				<article class="desc">
					<p> My name is Elijah Grall. I am 18 years old and currently attending the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in computer science. I am originally from Whitewater, Wisconsin, where I had lived all of my life before now. My family is just my parents and I and our yellow lab Bella. I enjoy being outdoors, hanging out with my friends, and playing tennis.
